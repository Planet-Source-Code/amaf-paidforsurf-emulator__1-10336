### Description

this works with paidforsurf, one of the hardest companies to emulate. so here is the source code to the emulator using two inet controls, and one webbrowser control. it will also emulate clicks! and it shows you the ad banner. it works great, and it clicks ad's every 30 minutes. get money from paidforsurf fast. use this code to your advantage to create your own emulators using this. give me credit, atleast add my name to the credits.
